# CS301 Embedded System and Microcomputer Principle
This is a repository for SUSTech CS301 Embedded System and Microcomputer Principle. **Assignments or projects with hyperlinks are recommended for access**.

- I was a student who learned this course in 2022 Fall, **one of the only two sophomores in this course while other students are juniors and seniors at that time**. The folder `2022-Fall` includes Lecture, Lab, Assignment, Final Project, etc. Enjoy your exploration on this repository!

  `Assignment1`: [Morse Code](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2022-Fall/Assignment/Assignment1)

  `Assignment2`: [Typing Exercise Machine](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2022-Fall/Assignment/Assignment2)

  `Assignment3`: [Pet Feeding System](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2022-Fall/Assignment/Assignment3)

  `Final Project`: [TBG Battle System](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2022-Fall/CS301-2022FALL-project-GROUP1)

- I am a **Student Assistant (SA)** for this course in 2023 Fall now. This job requires me to answer students' questions in the lab classroom on 14:00 - 16:00, Tuesday,  answer students' questions in QQ group, design assignments and check assignments, check lab practices and register scores for each examinee.

  The main contributions as a student assistant is summarized as follows:

  > Responsible for the design of Assignment1 in 2023 Fall. 
  >
  > Port the LCD driver from keilv5 to STM32Cube, enable the usage of LCD screen in MiniSTM32 V4.

  `Assignment1`: [Huffman Encoding and Decoding Machine(HEDM)](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2023-Fall/Assignment/Assignment1)

  `Assignment2`: Addition and Subtraction Game

  `Assignment3`: Real Person Verification System

  `Final Project`:  Smart-watch

  With this experience as a student assistant, I have gained a deeper understanding of embedded programming, honed my ability to port code, and honed my ability to find code bugs. More patient in answering students' questions, cultivating the ability to communicate with superiors, and getting to know a colleague who is a graduate student, Shiyu Chen... It is a work experience before entering society!
