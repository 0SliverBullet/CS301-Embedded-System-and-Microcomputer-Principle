# CS301 Embedded System and Microcomputer Principle
 This is a repository for SUSTech CS301 Embedded System and Microcomputer Principle.

- I was a student who learned this course in 2022 Fall, **one of the only two sophomores in this course while other students are juniors and seniors at that time**. The folder `2022-Fall` includes Lecture, Lab, Assignment and Final Project.

  Final Project: [CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/2022-Fall/CS301-2022FALL-project-GROUP1](https://github.com/0SliverBullet/CS301-Embedded-System-and-Microcomputer-Principle/tree/main/2022-Fall/CS301-2022FALL-project-GROUP1)
